# AO3Analyser

Developed methodology for a prototype that is able to perform quantitative research on AO3 online community. This tool scraps data from AO3’s website, using JavaScript, to access the tag system and obtain its tag structure. This information was instantiated as several computational networks and studied using graph theory and network analysis focusing on their changes over time, properties, and models.
